Now, he haunts the entire magical world and threatens to overthrow the government.\nBattle tactics: Before attacking, the Great lord closely studies his enemy until they know or at least predict their next move. Then he strategically organizes his large force so that his strongholds are fortefied but he also has a tactical advantage over his enemy.

            'Battle strategies book': """Defense:\nBoxing strategy - a tactic in which the enemy is surrounded on all sides. This tactic is effective because it secures your victory since the enemy is not given the opportunity to retreat.\nDefense in depth-to delay the advance of the attackers by buying time and causing additional casualties by yielding space so that the enemy's momentum of the attack is lost.\nOffense:\nAttrition warefare- A strategy of wearing down the enemy to the point of collapse through continuous loss of personnel and material. Used to defeat enemies with low resources and high morale.\nBlitzkrieg â€“ the attacking force, spearheaded by a dense concentration of armoured and motorised or mechanised infantry formations with close air support, breaks through the opponent's line of defence by short, fast, powerful attacks and then dislocates the defenders.""",
